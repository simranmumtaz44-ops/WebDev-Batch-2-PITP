        <h1>Simran Mumtaz</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Simran Mumtaz, a dedicated student currently studying in Jamshoro. I’m originally from Dadu, a peaceful town in Sindh, Pakistan. I’m passionate about learning and exploring new things, especially in the world of technology.</p>
        <p>I’ve recently started learning web development, and I’m excited to build my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to create simple, user-friendly websites that solve real-life problems. I believe that with the right effort, even small ideas can make a big impact.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love trying new hobbies, spending time with friends, and challenging myself to learn something new every day. I’m eager to grow, share my journey, and connect with others who share my interests.</p>
